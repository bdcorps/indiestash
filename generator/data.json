Moore shows that in the Technology Adoption Life Cycle—which begins with innovators and moves to early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards—there is a vast chasm between the early adopters and the early majority. While early adopters are willing to sacrifice for the advantage of being first, the early majority waits until they know that the technology actually offers improvements in productivity. The challenge for innovators and marketers is to narrow this chasm and ultimately accelerate adoption across every segment. </p><p>This third edition brings Moore's classic work up to date with dozens of new examples of successes and failures, new strategies for marketing in the digital world, and Moore's most current insights and findings.

But many of those failures are preventable.  The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. <br></b><br>Eric Ries defines a startup as <b>an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty</b>. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business. <br><br>The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively.  Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on “validated learning,” rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute. <br><br>Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, <i>The Lean Startup</i> offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it's too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.</p>","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0307887898"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780307887894"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":320,"printedPageCount":338,"dimensions":{"height":"22.00 cm","width":"15.00 cm","thickness":"2.90 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / Entrepreneurship","Business & Economics / New Business Enterprises","Business & Economics / Small Business"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":2171,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.8.2.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73hR6N2VaCIhE9eDbbhh6epGaOYNcjoD8my8yQKinkZz08hzQhRW7Ib7cQjRMxuTW0oJRn2GA87nrO0ZAE-bszNHnbEyMwFrkGEnm2wDX42J58vMZZ49AXTFIVnZOG2z5JGclaB&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72r0hsCXijMWVM96d5oWrY7ox_Xr_SZNknmKhSFfAdVQl8JcWZ1oQmzuPR1th5_BScPyoPwmPjRpB8HGx-NI7dh8U1ZKyrCsmrdLMdWwpdW0ClEidF61kPtNHnxTmBdrDGLvfYJ&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70FW5s4Ffuksrh8d-RqIiugvwN6gFzPrgVpES1dQln_5k-GE56W6jjKGZwAbtJXO4STKeQpWd35Zx2DQmwUamOe4NJQv1WsbGru-uE8Dl4HuHQE9X8j3jzUJ-A_h_XuMotQ_qZ2&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73-dlxv03vA9qSzCZmliliixlZtIMF4PDPPCzHWI0xtg2J_qtHHYn5KD_l6nN9Jo8ah0V6BCwiEoJirZOYKiz6gLoG5Dkr3zIXykxbu-f3BuLH11icnHzvjnPTshd83DLri0kOa&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73o74skc1CDZGYXr3sKp_dWO2Br1UCjcB8yIxpeIGab53rE2zVaZjPIwZ0O7FplcbMzLDOLjCDCyB4GMPgMM0k_q06YehhhUCOSaz6k0DY4A9V9CRx0e3dzFbsiT6Uo0QZkZjB0&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"ICSpCwAAQBAJ","etag":"CaLEGk94As8","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ICSpCwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Sprint","subtitle":"How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days","authors":["Jake Knapp","John Zeratsky","Braden Kowitz"],"publisher":"Simon and Schuster","publishedDate":"2016-03-08","description":"<b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER</b><br> <b><i>WALL STREET JOURNAL</i> BESTSELLER</b><br> <br> <b>“<i>Sprint</i> offers a transformative formula for testing ideas that works whether you’re at a startup or a large organization.

The real transformation--and the real opportunity--is just beginning. Subscription companies are growing nine times faster than the S&P 500. Why? Because unlike product companies, subscription companies know their customers. A happy subscriber base is the ultimate economic moat. Today's consumers prefer the advantages of access over the hassles of maintenance, from transportation (Uber, Surf Air), to clothing (Stitch Fix, Eleven James), to razor blades and makeup (Dollar Shave Club, Birchbox). Companies are similarly demanding easier, long-term solutions, trading their server rooms for cloud storage solutions like Box. Simply put, the world is shifting from products to services. But how do you turn customers into subscribers? As the CEO of the world's largest subscription management platform, Tien Tzuo has helped hundreds of companies transition from relying on individual sales to building customer-centric, recurring-revenue businesses. His core message in Subscribed is simple: Ready or not, excited or terrified, you need to adapt to the Subscription Economy -- or risk being left behind. Tzuo shows how to use subscriptions to build lucrative, ongoing one-on-one relationships with your customers. This may require reinventing substantial parts of your company, from your accounting practices to your entire IT architecture, but the payoff can be enormous.\"--","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0241363667"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780241363669"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":246,"printedPageCount":246,"dimensions":{"height":"24.00 cm","width":"15.40 cm","thickness":"2.10 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xN26swEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&imgtk=AFLRE70no_QUTWuWV2pNmwCnH-3QrVsp9-c25X0yHhiw3hkI6ZEUnbE8eLEWN2Ny13QAmxyk0Qrtvr9cj4LXb5gDW0MzzGES5Bj0NAIppCoUskEvGUMQeCw0tQ2zfS83eCfeBzGMnmlB&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xN26swEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE73VyiI4mO52rZP8tgE86uPG0GMBx0Ww1eR8sKJzFHy0yh4VeUT2EMpmzsBJJxbLkBRglTDsgc8ZAnDh9_cnQ_tdA6KX4TiLqxa6eBm6MKJRuGlthvda6hri9nhKFi7wKWei-cyB&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=xN26swEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xN26swEACAAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xN26swEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xN26swEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"WMl8DgAAQBAJ","etag":"c5BS5UK1ptQ","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/WMl8DgAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Hacking Growth","subtitle":"How Today's Fastest-growing Companies Drive Breakout Success","authors":["Sean Ellis","Morgan Brown"],"publisher":"Crown Business","publishedDate":"2017","description":"<b>The definitive playbook by the pioneers of Growth Hacking, one of the hottest business methodologies in Silicon Valley and beyond.<br></b><br> It seems hard to believe today, but there was a time when Airbnb was the best-kept secret of travel hackers and couch surfers, Pinterest was a niche web site frequented only by bakers and crafters, LinkedIn was an exclusive network for C-suite executives and top-level recruiters, Facebook was MySpace's sorry step-brother, and Uber was a scrappy upstart that didn't stand a chance against the Goliath that was New York City Yellow Cabs. <br> <br> So how did these companies grow from these humble beginnings into the powerhouses they are today? Contrary to popular belief, they didn't explode to massive worldwide popularity simply by building a great product then crossing their fingers and hoping it would catch on. There was a studied, carefully implemented methodology behind these companies' extraordinary rise. That methodology is called Growth Hacking, and it's practitioners include not just today's hottest start-ups, but also companies like IBM, Walmart, and Microsoft as well as the millions of entrepreneurs, marketers, managers and executives who make up the community of Growth Hackers.<br> <br> Think of the Growth Hacking methodology as doing for market-share growth what Lean Start-Up did for product development, and Scrum did for productivity. It involves cross-functional teams and rapid-tempo testing and iteration that focuses <i>customers</i>: attaining them, retaining them, engaging them, and motivating them to come back and buy more. <br> <b><br></b> An accessible and practical toolkit that teams and companies in all industries can use to increase their customer base and market share, this book walks readers through the process of creating and executing their own custom-made growth hacking strategy. It is a must read for any marketer, entrepreneur, innovator or manger looking to replace wasteful big bets and \"spaghetti-on-the-wall\" approaches with more consistent, replicable, cost-effective, and data-driven results.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"045149721X"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780451497215"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":308,"printedPageCount":322,"dimensions":{"height":"25.00 cm","width":"16.20 cm","thickness":"2.90 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["BUSINESS & ECONOMICS / Consumer Behavior","Business & Economics / Development / Business Development","BUSINESS & ECONOMICS / Marketing / Direct"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.3.0.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70-nOdL85ARDs240N7zFcDdgtnrJ9btjOfuW2ismSWEreNzUTIW2RB4TahhhLSj4HX0bsl3d_9AxoFXeUWMecdfLZqMwKQy76KKHnPHiaMHQhERZ_JHuLbuXgnC8AgMbi8kCAT3&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73kazV_TbNl6DyZKKBxy7N7mb_hRArGHIwir8OaD8BX73t5Nav_LNy6HMMdBvubKdUZBVLUpWSgR_jsICCNs5txugT0vQsB6DG2ihqxHrRTUN6aI81x49o8pw-eh_0ddiIdwRU1&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE7233g7MPKBV9Mik4t1zaYQksIL9C6syOj86tghp-0B6X4vnP76_a8R7Mt5qdacfJmkhmK6aH-mSvxHdZ87TRSuvN9YYTZD1KQB7uOJFDRjpccKvWKK97ds7Dbl4PRgCv-DaCefL&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72zzoqTBUUIQn5dz-zZeJ50cQ5hiSvXP_YaUzWyjNigU3kpM9EMuyEsLzf7qNb9q5fN-NhGZYOKy7Ow07VQ-INT9TPqhqAO1NVik6b__nKQ4N5O7Ub0TGcD74LIMe8sazJ9KqRz&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70Tx0xGEGbWPNFsU-Bcc58uqGZKf-eFLBpL5sZoHZI51d2JliVVVCSbGKC9HwrFg0eqDQ9cFYUVMqWLLlX8CWyADqo6JoKeYbrgykgcffIDN8PW6NJcQs2i8P4ZhT5b0O3ahFgx&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"E4MlCp5qEQ0C","etag":"dmFZromUSms","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/E4MlCp5qEQ0C","volumeInfo":{"title":"Endless Referrals","subtitle":"Network Your Everyday Contacts Into Sales","authors":["Bob Burg"],"publisher":"McGraw Hill","publishedDate":"2002","description":"With over 100,000 copies sold, this is one of the most popular business- and sales-boosting guides ever written.

But customers can be fickle, markets shift, and competitors are ruthless. So how do you ensure a steady flow of repeat business? The secret—no matter what industry you’re in—is finding and keeping <i>automatic customers</i>.</b><br><br>These days virtually anything you need can be purchased through a subscription, with more convenience than ever before. Far beyond Spotify, Netflix, and <i>New York Times </i>subscriptions, you can sign up for weekly or monthly supplies of everything from groceries (AmazonFresh) to cosmetics (Birchbox) to razor blades (Dollar Shave Club).<br><br>According to John Warrillow, this emerging subscription economy offers huge opportunities to companies that know how to turn customers into subscribers. Automatic customers are the key to increasing cash flow, igniting growth, and boosting the value of your company.<br><br>Consider Whatsapp, the internet-based messaging service that was purchased by Facebook for $19 billion. While other services bombarded users with invasive ads in order to fund a free messaging platform, Whatsapp offered a refreshingly private tool on a subscription platform, charging just $1 per year. Their business model enabled the kind of service that customers wanted and ensured automatic customers for years to come.<br><br>As Warrillow shows, subscriptions aren’t limited to technology or media businesses. Companies in nearly any industry, from start-ups to the Fortune 500, from home contractors to florists, can build subscriptions into their business.<br><br>Warrillow provides the essential blueprint for winning automatic customers with one of the nine subscription business models, including:<br><br>   •  <b>The Membership Website Model</b>: Companies like The Wood Whisperer Guild, ContractorSelling, and DanceStudioOwner offer access to highly specialized, high quality information, recognizing that people will pay for good content. This model can work for any business with a tightly defined niche market and insider information.<br>   •  <b>The Simplifier Model</b>: Companies like Mosquito Squad (pest control) and Hassle Free Homes (home maintenance) take a recurring task off your to-do list. Any business serving busy consumers can adopt this model not only to create a recurring revenue stream, but also to take advantage of the opportunity to cross-sell or bundle their services.<br>   •  <b>The Surprise Box Model</b>: Companies like BarkBox (dog treats) and Standard Cocoa (craft chocolate) send their subscribers curated packages of goodies each month. If you can handle the logistics of shipping, giving customers joy in something new can translate to sales on your larger e-commerce site.<br><br>This book also shows you how to master the psychology of selling subscriptions and how to reduce churn and provides a road map for the essential statistics you need to measure the health of your subscription business.<br><br>Whether you want to transform your entire business into a recurring revenue engine or just pick up an extra 5 percent of sales growth, <i>The Automatic Customer</i> will be your secret weapon.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0698176332"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780698176331"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":224,"printedPageCount":226,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / Small Business","Business & Economics / Entrepreneurship","Business & Economics / Marketing / General"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.6.4.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=Xs46BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE717dzy_0f2w6bJJL1w1fY97RNQHdddue461nlwtGVlXEV_PdK4PcSYQJ_GBqwFcZO4LqFrtDcLFUdPZi-DrYtrXhramhSPuX0R1kyG94BgKDjckjOivioRUp-1wf8nhG27t_wlc&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=Xs46BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72R5hpRT8ZhnE5tkHt4Ggdts5nFvEaPVDv5YkyR7tcGRYmw1r2k0W8gFnLkyfKBYpFBrn__xjZ61Zy9eAI91zp0hkMZEUTCE5KwmDD9bc_Wg1wRQgTaU3dsQQ6W0UhEY7oznNnV&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=Xs46BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72eFOBsbh4V_kMMmFFqdKhgzP9sUg2kLsz2os1DyMBWrPrh-SvxjOZO3MoYQSlGHsTeTfbav2O2K3UpSVY_bSkcfRsvTG7yvQXQAaSXxXXrlgZNZ_P1MHJq8G3JPLn5PMcS8oR3&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=Xs46BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72FHm8IEOCtPyIlaGmZKJHQw4SJtU97Hy7ceuRfg0m7qNMbgkWHJySqtcGKunmX5y9aHYaaunBTQyYGKgyejh_hynKtPAQ3Y748UAGDDUejqdW9nRSPc0qkJ5l8gqDtQN9-jVkS&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=Xs46BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72tKp_S9BWKwc8QDuRBOLYWYf3eEfH5qHEP4Ovwy7pqV8-X_rEyCI3qqusNAXziDv7GI10mGZblmfui6OsaSIL5p3SEUAh7R3zDjJMFLyPwRNbzMKS5NL55RBaAvohmQXUlhl05&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=Xs46BAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xs46BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xs46BAAAQBAJ"},"layerInfo":{"layers":[{"layerId":"geo","volumeAnnotationsVersion":"8"}]},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":13.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":13.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xs46BAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Xs46BAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":13990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":13990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.ca/books/download/The_Automatic_Customer-sample-epub.acsm?id=Xs46BAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Xs46BAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"P0PJw8qQ__AC","etag":"x0tiKMmOnTc","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/P0PJw8qQ__AC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Good to Great","subtitle":"Why Some Companies Make the Leap...And Others Don't","authors":["Jim Collins"],"publisher":"HarperCollins","publishedDate":"2001-10-16","description":"<p><b>The Challenge </b><br><i>Built to Last,</i> the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the verybeginning. </p><p>But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? </p><p><b>The Study </b><br>For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? </p><p><b>The Standards </b><br>Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck.</p><p><b>The Comparisons <br></b>The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? </p><p>Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don't. </p><p><b>The Findings</b><br> The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:</p><ul><li><b>Level 5 Leaders:</b> The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. </li><li><b>The Hedgehog Concept</b> (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. </li><li><b>A Culture of Discipline:</b> When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results.

You wear a certain jacket because you liked how it looked. You picked a particular career because you found it interesting. The notion that our choices are driven by our own personal thoughts and opinions is patently obvious. Right? Wrong.<br> <br>Without our realizing it, other people’s behavior has a huge influence on everything we do at every moment of our lives, from the mundane to the momentous. Even strangers have an impact on our judgments and decisions: our attitudes toward a welfare policy shift if we’re told it is supported by Democrats versus Republicans (even though the policy is the same). But social influence doesn’t just lead us to do the same things as others. In some cases we imitate others around us. But in other cases we <i>avoid</i> particular choices or behaviors because other people are doing them. We stop listening to a band because they go mainstream. We skip buying the minivan because we don’t want to look like a soccer mom.<br> <br>By understanding how social influence works, we can decide when to resist and when to embrace it—and learn how we can use this knowledge to exercise more control over our own behavior. In <i>Invisible Influence</i>, Jonah Berger “is consistently entertaining, applying science to real life in surprising ways and explaining research through narrative. His book fascinates because it opens up the moving parts of a mysterious machine, allowing readers to watch them in action” (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>).","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1476759731"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781476759739"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":272,"printedPageCount":272,"dimensions":{"height":"21.30 cm","width":"14.00 cm","thickness":"1.80 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / General","Business & Economics / Marketing / General","Social Science / General"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=f90nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73wGucDCOyvwx9COkb-o6v0aSF0RKdXQtk9iy5tX-d9jCs8ZrPLQIs3QdD8ovN-7K6vFhuTuSYO0D4sGIjJtMrmYGqq0okIEh4mUE1wC4rd-eo--lD4Kgp2T8wYJli02OV0uQ57&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=f90nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE737sa4cZugFE7g0B5S6v3FLaMOyUxUGjJ3B_zga4kdIKhcJ37AQG17sFP__0XuUO-Oltq2NJqBZCrLJGgGeHGvGcR-mLLRkYGJaNYTdxg6l-Ega-wNTZ1VGjpivw-6JT9dvzSNk&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=f90nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71V_BaKS1_b7F3-wRFDu6u6wd6vtsZ9NhYYsFkZrWNeiz-L-zfLDvrbkYV5vdei_zBlWU_z55fb0TQZAKnQ_Ntp_IZhHFOJWmryhnwUH-dpUsFyVhoSvjql8WjvySbsGbaJzdrH&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=f90nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72il_aSiG-H-2SqKMQHCjSCGY6pPGYCLVREKFtTW1IkQhhNCn_mPIhZmjjMdvbPcfs8fbS5eYLqa_bZhyMTYf5axve1XElhEfTPwNJic7iy0un-NvhjI1YgcmICKJQR06IdTZnW&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=f90nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71iPZG3onoNaIspbtON5qMIgX_TVlS4bIP4UQF4y_z7qZh7pW3BkaDm5S6lm8vVskr2O7CDfdYuh6kJvsiXtyUZyP5U6NzMdBTeRpTAtxzu1bmkQNwYVL8Flvdp5_SRW7-3VDo8&source=gbs_api","extraLarge":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=f90nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73TcOkGm9-bGCTMMuiLc_zSPOpAXdAQ8lRK-C7pRApg91JdK8gcAYGaxhWNVx9ghTCduypqdBIdQJc9Ni1eYG6pERCYT_4xqfkMn0ITywQFd6QYDqjUzpGG1lYMySNquUwDNXPj&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=f90nDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f90nDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f90nDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=f90nDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"b3xDDgAAQBAJ","etag":"sCo2FmesG8M","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/b3xDDgAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Building a StoryBrand","subtitle":"Clarify Your Message So Customers Will Listen","authors":["Donald Miller"],"publisher":"HarperCollins Leadership","publishedDate":"2017-10-10","description":"<p>More than half-a-million business leaders have discovered the power of the StoryBrand Framework, created by New York Times best-selling author and marketing expert Donald Miller.

If you're like most business leaders, you'd say it's fundamentally about relationships-and you'd be wrong. The best salespeople don't just build relationships with customers. They challenge them. </b><p>The need to understand what top-performing reps are doing that their average performing colleagues are not drove Matthew Dixon, Brent Adamson, and their colleagues at Corporate Executive Board to investigate the skills, behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes that matter most for high performance. And what they discovered may be the biggest shock to conventional sales wisdom in decades.</p><p>Based on an exhaustive study of thousands of sales reps across multiple industries and geographies, <i>The Challenger Sale</i> argues that classic relationship building is a losing approach, especially when it comes to selling complex, large-scale business-to-business solutions. The authors' study found that every sales rep in the world falls into one of five distinct profiles, and while all of these types of reps can deliver average sales performance, only one-the Challenger- delivers consistently high performance.</p><p>Instead of bludgeoning customers with endless facts and features about their company and products, Challengers approach customers with unique insights about how they can save or make money. They tailor their sales message to the customer's specific needs and objectives. Rather than acquiescing to the customer's every demand or objection, they are assertive, pushing back when necessary and taking control of the sale.</p><p>The things that make Challengers unique are replicable and teachable to the average sales rep. Once you understand how to identify the Challengers in your organization, you can model their approach and embed it throughout your sales force. The authors explain how almost any average-performing rep, once equipped with the right tools, can successfully reframe customers' expectations and deliver a distinctive purchase experience that drives higher levels of customer loyalty and, ultimately, greater growth.</p>","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1591844355"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781591844358"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":240,"printedPageCount":242,"dimensions":{"height":"24.00 cm","width":"15.70 cm","thickness":"2.30 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / Sales & Selling / Management","Business & Economics / Organizational Behavior"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.1.0.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=L7qJDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71mPRSDgPEEXGGzCxXMOXYaTX9TSdZZqNqMrY3LvQpM4m0FEyyYyBgpghsBJjr1V6luyvE-n98ScuekT6jpjOMwTClNcnDRy8f_h3k4WqoGSybjn8C9sw6XYkUshSeYscvB_IRP&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=L7qJDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71HYYJn1mxP5mXLViPFfCmYp3Z2T_7rpYeI567ec_T7c1eliNt4JkpnyWogyDqPuGmXMI5Mho-kZpkBcAtJQt8p72zqSXtitxCcXZNXCjc49Mzin8R7zxQF_MUAegi9Xw4nbpko&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=L7qJDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73A2KSfyuecdY8R5TH7LjpGf_-7HYnOjXXJZhOWS0f2hbZCDO8J5_iNkpJNOv18d5aP77L1QQEupRHUyr7HZlQMkpc9bXI4WgmbuQGfCFggXepTeihI62-tW_LoQ_iQXO1zl6w-&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=L7qJDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE739qUKQeoix3ePPvhcwHN-YnmgAZHRC8XXFXbfH3XlNIqALVmyyHS6Wckq8QmvSbtcF9kHsBzKvuuyfUEXGfDDBvIznUzxQkwLJxFPLsy2igpv40B5NEB7SnK8NIsze4LoCkqJE&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=L7qJDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72bZLeR5QNdNPe6yoQq1aMJtW4uZDLaLhoXy5-22ZpLsEddsHzjLWu80mNOdICO-3H2OLolnsT9h9bBgM5a91cCMJtGOMHfsjADek5QW9xWNhOMbbvrCOIOe78g5Qy4k-1TK7B-&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=L7qJDQAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L7qJDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L7qJDQAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=L7qJDQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"WMl8DgAAQBAJ","etag":"FokwmUdO+OQ","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/WMl8DgAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Hacking Growth","subtitle":"How Today's Fastest-growing Companies Drive Breakout Success","authors":["Sean Ellis","Morgan Brown"],"publisher":"Crown Business","publishedDate":"2017","description":"<b>The definitive playbook by the pioneers of Growth Hacking, one of the hottest business methodologies in Silicon Valley and beyond.<br></b><br> It seems hard to believe today, but there was a time when Airbnb was the best-kept secret of travel hackers and couch surfers, Pinterest was a niche web site frequented only by bakers and crafters, LinkedIn was an exclusive network for C-suite executives and top-level recruiters, Facebook was MySpace's sorry step-brother, and Uber was a scrappy upstart that didn't stand a chance against the Goliath that was New York City Yellow Cabs. <br> <br> So how did these companies grow from these humble beginnings into the powerhouses they are today? Contrary to popular belief, they didn't explode to massive worldwide popularity simply by building a great product then crossing their fingers and hoping it would catch on. There was a studied, carefully implemented methodology behind these companies' extraordinary rise. That methodology is called Growth Hacking, and it's practitioners include not just today's hottest start-ups, but also companies like IBM, Walmart, and Microsoft as well as the millions of entrepreneurs, marketers, managers and executives who make up the community of Growth Hackers.<br> <br> Think of the Growth Hacking methodology as doing for market-share growth what Lean Start-Up did for product development, and Scrum did for productivity. It involves cross-functional teams and rapid-tempo testing and iteration that focuses <i>customers</i>: attaining them, retaining them, engaging them, and motivating them to come back and buy more. <br> <b><br></b> An accessible and practical toolkit that teams and companies in all industries can use to increase their customer base and market share, this book walks readers through the process of creating and executing their own custom-made growth hacking strategy. It is a must read for any marketer, entrepreneur, innovator or manger looking to replace wasteful big bets and \"spaghetti-on-the-wall\" approaches with more consistent, replicable, cost-effective, and data-driven results.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"045149721X"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780451497215"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":308,"printedPageCount":322,"dimensions":{"height":"25.00 cm","width":"16.20 cm","thickness":"2.90 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["BUSINESS & ECONOMICS / Consumer Behavior","Business & Economics / Development / Business Development","BUSINESS & ECONOMICS / Marketing / Direct"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.3.0.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72LfZ6YycMeeBbpWiB1VtXjKDc4mWfccmXS-2N0_5UZWTKzr8xIKYfEzU0Xeg6bZ7thiITtCgoEtnkPwntda0D7_2yqQ_qd3oL4rZL72hb7jWfArEw0_fbV-Oj9_JP3Pxs9fOWh&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72TOD7YxuMBWz85Ks44pYFO9LvLakJyXpJj00y3sfqTghuCdGIiMuThBxbInxVVC4tpI-c09nqtJ-GOUqxxFOVwVpEZ5lCE1-VM7j7xcXoQRkjagsKz9Y8opmL8KxikwP1PwbQi&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73cHlpphSFEXZcAq-Z_uOU_c-dQWLlkuMQXv_mngceeowhiO0BjqeZHMlkFhFhVkDA9bU775hmpGVVJuKCf6s3SlNFArDZm9GV_t_Qb3aFDfLq_YMyptICESHnL_L_xoOK_hZ2M&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70oxozpxXEDjG3aUlxsSiCXp5lMjqdRe3jY-bC5wA_rvikouwcdwtCsCL96Wt-kSavTkermvxqhzuFeTbTEU4JovcoDI08s_iC4l0i2E-4vw2p5opjwnvE9ZFhILTE1BwMHog4C&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70RW3ehmku-53ru5P_a6JUCC6mmFA-vaA3DT-5ZXFdhdoJwQ8tZShlpocPU2JTEkLho1g0nQnyKoJRNGz2n4Z2a-QKtGyLImotD09n3AdTCJrsHHe-v8Bi0JtDulyOzUK1p_QEv&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WMl8DgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"QGtECQAAQBAJ","etag":"yvvsiMPH3CU","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QGtECQAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Everybody Writes","subtitle":"Your Go-To Guide to Creating Ridiculously Good Content","authors":["Ann Handley"],"publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","publishedDate":"2014-09-15","description":"<b><i>Finally a go-to guide to creating and publishing the kind of content that will make your business thrive.</i></b> <p><i>Everybody Writes</i> is a go-to guide to attracting and retaining customers through stellar online communication, because in our content-driven world, every one of us is, in fact, a writer.</p> <p>If you have a web site, you are a publisher. If you are on social media, you are in marketing. And that means that we are all relying on our words to carry our marketing messages. We are all writers.</p> <p>Yeah, but who cares about writing anymore? In a time-challenged world dominated by short and snappy, by click-bait headlines and Twitter streams and Instagram feeds and gifs and video and Snapchat and YOLO and LOL and #tbt. . . does the idea of focusing on writing seem pedantic and ordinary?</p> <p>Actually, writing matters more now, not less. Our online words are our currency; they tell our customers who we are.</p> <p>Our writing can make us look smart or it can make us look stupid. It can make us seem fun, or warm, or competent, or trustworthy. But it can also make us seem humdrum or discombobulated or flat-out boring.</p> <p>That means you've got to choose words well, and write with economy and the style and honest empathy for your customers. And it means you put a new value on an often-overlooked skill in content marketing: How to write, and how to tell a true story really, really well. That's true whether you're writing a listicle or the words on a Slideshare deck or the words you're reading right here, right now...</p> <p>And so being able to communicate well in writing isn't just nice; it's necessity. And it's also the oft-overlooked cornerstone of nearly all our content marketing.</p> <p>In <i>Everybody Writes</i>, top marketing veteran Ann Handley gives expert guidance and insight into the process and strategy of content creation, production and publishing, with actionable how-to advice designed to get results.</p> <p>These lessons and rules apply across all of your online assets — like web pages, home page, landing pages, blogs, email, marketing offers, and on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other social media. Ann deconstructs the strategy and delivers a practical approach to create ridiculously compelling and competent content. It's designed to be the go-to guide for anyone creating or publishing any kind of online content — whether you're a big brand or you're small and solo.</p> <p>Sections include:</p> <ul> <li>How to write better. (Or, for \"adult-onset writers\": How to hate writing less.)</li> <li>Easy grammar and usage rules tailored for business in a fun, memorable way. (Enough to keep you looking sharp, but not too much to overwhelm you.)</li> <li>Giving your audience the gift of your true story, told well. Empathy and humanity and inspiration are key here, so the book covers that, too.</li> <li>Best practices for creating credible, trustworthy content steeped in some time-honored rules of solid journalism. Because publishing content and talking directly to your customers is, at its heart, a privilege.</li> <li>\"Things Marketers Write\": The fundamentals of 17 specific kinds of content that marketers are often tasked with crafting.</li> <li>Content Tools: The sharpest tools you need to get the job done.</li> </ul> <p>Traditional marketing techniques are no longer enough. <i>Everybody Writes</i> is a field guide for the smartest businesses who know that great content is the key to thriving in this digital world.</p>","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1118905555"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781118905555"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":320,"printedPageCount":320,"dimensions":{"height":"24.00 cm","width":"15.00 cm","thickness":"3.00 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / General","Business & Economics / Business Communication / General","Business & Economics / Marketing / General"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.4.2.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=QGtECQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72fOVGgrFjS9gw4Rqx3OX8vc3DpA8Ek1SDW8DlnzINMHxv7CeRY8VPEXpDXFQP_FYluya41s61GLBSnTt9mR6JoeimY6QOCDvD6FhCVYfFOXYabEpxHmMok27waqAfm73m0MtrB&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=QGtECQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73sWcZSTEftUoioi9_hlefgXTW-27pJgv2tMNe7d0B8WrggtpHVIhZCtSg2czpei9_aQRs3C_pLKQIfEOlEnI6o7qwZYsntfJL6KbONDEqiEFcMUJmtJiLfDebUMctyHWiFc3q3&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=QGtECQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73ui01CBwwVNq3Ej1UBJmhfwKJOfd1vm3YZyS_1az9j3ZqsRySZlrcQdFXrKdOiLLo9bSpPU0BiSsktgfBbhWk7ASkqr9ymhtnmS__QGwRj_Nq_sCdDbXQ-VbUvDJK7cMYXVZ5F&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=QGtECQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72JH4pciDFYlc1btE3Jo-fgge_W0gjr9O_0w3pxI9rIKF1vWUsBr8-JkhVPbdcb85O0oeFBFJ0APR9VLdZgGNpBli1xBHjPz5eVBI5zwnMmhLv8WLjLYCn36OU-4G9EPzw_L-jS&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=QGtECQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73Qeli2uCJOxJIzrLW2Ck4Y-gULy-KM2wkrw_iymiLNU6JV7y3UYlsLi1xm-tLkDyIECIS6_CyqPznNSYKpa_cKJ7jYIw66MXp3nVUc9Il-KLf7-NaSP9F3fgM7x73y5qcf34tk&source=gbs_api","extraLarge":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=QGtECQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73FPLWqrrXUgkm6jfJZmTsy4x440bByl7rih-ZW0RRU91z9XbQILdSLTpsJI5aElwtMuvJOppBDZpzs8FOOjQ_yiud97whQwQvF-Kd_YAJbaG9rXw6J1xOffTgFe4L49dGBA_HZ&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=QGtECQAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QGtECQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QGtECQAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QGtECQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"Z28fAAAAMAAJ","etag":"UKEg1C1RIic","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Z28fAAAAMAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Copywriter's Handbook","subtitle":"A Step-by-step Guide to Writing Copy that Sells","authors":["Robert W.

Kupor explains, for instance:<br><br>   • Why most VCs typically invest in only one startup in a given business category. <br><br>   • Why the skill you need most when raising venture capital is the ability to tell a compelling story. <br><br>   • How to handle a \"down round,\" when startups have to raise funds at a lower valuation than in the previous round. <br><br>   • What to do when VCs get too entangled in the day-to-day operations of the business. <br><br>   • Why you need to build relationships with potential acquirers long before you decide to sell. <br><br> Filled with Kupor's firsthand experiences, insider advice, and practical takeaways, <i>Secrets of Sand Hill Road</i> is the guide every entrepreneur needs to turn their startup into the next unicorn.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0593083598"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780593083598"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":320,"printedPageCount":322,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / Corporate Finance / Venture Capital","Business & Economics / Entrepreneurship","Business & Economics / New Business Enterprises"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.3.1.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=HnuDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73x-hrobLH4u0zMnHVWprKmlfRYdraSA-OBhW8dra2sDsshsMlfxsMeUd4SGMdFXpSdU1LNmEJt1uv3E1U9QUnSrMmTGrczI5wpcYRk5rrcCtG0XFhJ2Nv2OwNZSxugMSy97mAh&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=HnuDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71D2OYxcKrlYF3ItVnYD4L6SDwVLXbL66svFkKdFhwOWiKnx8OUaMCHEWA5ix6ltYj1su6vPXGshAaa4nZjtCbmtc3uwrXly-ylRLzA08hGLulybQYvCEBFDc3U8xTytNfVEda7&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=HnuDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71m3rrGYMs1mgnzfg6DT0X_ax1qjX6e4iW1CpfrYdRaRaBPrZOFj-4spHCfKe9-utx65I759xCPtFQFu0Z_TeNB9Gmq2Elje4BQ7WxtL4tqdNoJEwiAO1xWewU-8DnCOmyM1Xet&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=HnuDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71wvn_Q5b_sfFpsq5HWsMJ5lwkiejnxcmjjlIsJLIJHtT9CK7HQJo-Y4bsm73UZ5JpTec5WUKxXSwZSU4LCc9QprJckuuueGs3mYsM8egDpdJJAmj-6UI42Za668BBijKdamI7x&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=HnuDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72Mz3CHakkYv8UNKepZDuy0LacgjJy5FwZE_t6rtsj06DTnOo4Lhfoxf7V0bOJhbytX7Pm9nY4Q57GZg-BtqqEeecE7KLWAIDOTdRj8bknqfOOmbSkpcW76TZM085CoXnWPNvQh&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=HnuDDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HnuDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HnuDDwAAQBAJ"},"layerInfo":{"layers":[{"layerId":"geo","volumeAnnotationsVersion":"3"}]},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":16.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":16.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HnuDDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-HnuDDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":16990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":16990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.ca/books/download/Secrets_of_Sand_Hill_Road-sample-epub.acsm?id=HnuDDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=HnuDDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"k6eRjgEACAAJ","etag":"Yk78hctYyPA","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/k6eRjgEACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Pitch Anything: An Innovative Method for Presenting, Persuading, and Winning the Deal","authors":["Oren Klaff"],"publisher":"Mcgraw-hill","publishedDate":"2011-01-26","description":"<p><b>Gold Medal Winner--Tops Sales World's Best Sales and Marketing Book</b></p> <p>“Fast, fun and immensely practical.”<br><b> —JOE SULLIVAN, Founder, Flextronics</b></p> <p>“Move over Neil Strauss and game theory. <i>Pitch Anything</i> reveals the next big thing in social dynamics: game for business.”<br> <b>—JOSH WHITFORD, Founder, Echelon Media</b></p> <p>“What do supermodels and venture capitalists have in common?

The problem is, businesses are run by humans, and humans aren't always logical. Serial entrepreneur Mike Michalowicz has developed a behavioral approach to accounting to flip the formula: Sales - Profit = Expenses. Just as the most effective weight loss strategy is to limit portions by using smaller plates, Michalowicz shows that by taking profit first and apportioning only what remains for expenses, entrepreneurs will transform their businesses from cash-eating monsters to profitable cash cows. Using Michalowicz's Profit First system, readers will learn that:<br><br>· Following 4 simple principles can simplify accounting and make it easier to manage a profitable business by looking at bank account balances.<br>· A small, profitable business can be worth much more than a large business surviving on its top line.<br>· Businesses that attain early and sustained profitability have a better shot at achieving long-term growth.<br><br>With dozens of case studies, practical, step-by-step advice, and his signature sense of humor, Michalowicz has the game-changing roadmap for any entrepreneur to make money they always dreamed of.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0735214166"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780735214163"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":224,"printedPageCount":226,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / Entrepreneurship","Business & Economics / Small Business","Business & Economics / International / Accounting"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.15.11.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=k155DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73nvK4PQ_OskDb2PocoE75wOwrAt5IGCVnI4QozRR17XvtPNDgCHl_FaPfJ-eDOttGucX4MX147-asomVhqQZvh6sNxoSPKBiryEqR1uXUNZx9rEGQ6v8ux90t07m8R6-LrtnEO&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=k155DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71P2Y6XlekwH4dLzwvHXh_PSISY1x1j7X4GpjgI_VI9RA8l7jQ2jdxHAYz3W16cUXui2xBLqt1fIXKbgdlw26xWG9CY1gwmbESuffPrOtuKI274G7U9izOWce7g3rq8oFQ4Fxxf&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=k155DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73dQufZHt5k-_KHMGylWZgx3ad-_iwUXh9fPX4T5Z0W97GG0cTKpiZNtov1okeqfeqxNow1Zwhs_XvXPSCLKlar51qoHfnP2rfl4hjC_pAWD84UNhIfHh8l8ihHyldxXavPlAlu&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=k155DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72ysX7hqU2euIslSAa0YJM3WLJUn63qwaBWB1t-mV4DElfJjOkLEEshrskg8FMoxJ6XXic2KMYSAvisqqg3wUIpIP4rT-U6na256JI3bcLEQNNxknWYLXazKBwlQFC-MWRnAZIc&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=k155DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71i9kaga1jvbYnuV_tQh8o6mi-3yPdTPrx--PIroB_BQY3Q92BNnulJ5Ypa6E1Wy26C7ecw-Z25WAwh6HR7ZkEkaG-bZBYNhv_PZIWo2GZClr2VgXGg6ois_w9ww060oGnoXP9D&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=k155DAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k155DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k155DAAAQBAJ"},"layerInfo":{"layers":[{"layerId":"geo","volumeAnnotationsVersion":"19"}]},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":15.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":15.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k155DAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-k155DAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":15990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":15990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.ca/books/download/Profit_First-sample-epub.acsm?id=k155DAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=k155DAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"fX-azQEACAAJ","etag":"A9Sal6vB7Ms","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/fX-azQEACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Zero to Sold","subtitle":"How to Start, Run, and Sell a Bootstrapped Business","authors":["Arvid Kahl"],"publisher":"Arvid Kahl","publishedDate":"2020-07-03","description":"<p>Zero to Sold is a comprehensive and actionable guide through the four stages of a bootstrapped business: Preparation, Survival, Stability, and Growth.</p><p><br></p><p>From your first idea to successfully selling your business for life-changing amounts of money, this book will help you become a world-class entrepreneur.

In 2016 in the United States alone, more than 31 percent of small business owners reported that they could not access adequate capital, and the lack of capital prevented them from growing the business/expanding operations, increasing inventory, or financing increased sales.</p><p>Most business owners believe that their only feasible funding options are (1) savings or personal credit, (2) friends and family or (3) bank loans. They may have heard about venture capitalists or angel investors, but they don’t have enough information about what these investors do, what they can provide for a business, and on what terms. What’s worse, entrepreneurs often don’t know how to access the people who are looking to put their money into young companies with potential.</p><p>Finally, business owners don’t have enough expertise to navigate the treacherous waters of outside funding. Many small companies don’t believe they are the type of company that gets funded. Even when business owners are brave enough to look for the right outside investors, they don’t know how to create the compelling pitches or how to structure the deals that will get them the funding to expand and grow.</p><p>Crack the Funding Code will show readers how to find the money, create pitches that attract investors, and then structure fair, ethical deals that will bring them new sources of outside capital and invaluable professional advice. It will give readers the broader perspective—how funding works, how investors think, and what they need to hear to put their money where your mouth is. Every entrepreneur who reads this book will get easy-to-follow deal checklists, a roadmap of where and how to locate the best funding resources and top business mentors for their particular industry and/or geographical location, and a step-by-step process to create pitches that make their idea or business irresistible.</p>","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0814439845"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780814439845"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":272,"printedPageCount":273,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / Entrepreneurship","Business & Economics / Crowdfunding","Business & Economics / Corporate Finance / Valuation"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.2.2.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=0KNbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE702zzUAjGofBVk0t7TbpOFq6hYxZDVllqYawjn9aIA6FvzznOQZOJhD_80HN4f8_057lq98PthObSrteUeOe1N6XcOnJMf3nGwOVNKEMgmFUzJIrCDBaifuAgHrsaWt2I6OjuYW&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=0KNbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73c4u8Rx1l43YfQgaoH5FDNXUwJqYr2rCHiClNarfSo-csoCMsoivHJl5hdXLmue82OFq-oMKowMi70ChRlKkRNw_6jga0RT8d4kp4HvjYuIF0BLH3wwqnLjMLw58_Y3B6H5CEt&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=0KNbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70h5n7jA0RQmrBFRBGDt6olMo3gmalw4yvTu8x6EVO7HhCAL4EMUAJRc_oE8Xj1hSqfY_KWpH12CovlK7FGhRwn3_NzTkBbrVipDiLXk5ITY0nM0wnzn7DXwKNMascXBg3r8nYZ&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=0KNbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE7351gBQLqAligEXx3dbuhx3a-I3JlXs1sX_YQdSPjLccXsIZH8ubS2DoZLlH8gSw1cvpXxgd28TO8q7XYv9e_PpzTiLRs2LMME7OvSgBCtP6Q80Emv90dM4xxDhz9N3tUroB2Jn&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=0KNbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70qyX6kj57kwIu2tpWXYYYezMOPcMjSvvzdvfpdfpQWwvPlJ_BTezcAy0eDW85YWXq30WJW6KQvIFkR1wwaAcuEClclUAl6VcJwQlUOlYqHPzSs9br_tB7rJvlZCndotL-Ed5BK&source=gbs_api","extraLarge":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=0KNbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73Q6EdC6j8pxxMDMd_FVAABtBTbSTwgbv3_WY9g5oZKbfXgCuSWPejnHuMNSlsH31zQr3muJgYuGMDIfjgGJinZhBoxrs_Pmlb-gSx-9PNH9mgCjCzk9hGnDuDgR5XuuHYubfRS&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=0KNbDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0KNbDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0KNbDwAAQBAJ"},"layerInfo":{"layers":[{"layerId":"geo","volumeAnnotationsVersion":"4"}]},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":12.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":12.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0KNbDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-0KNbDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":12990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":12990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.ca/books/download/Crack_the_Funding_Code-sample-epub.acsm?id=0KNbDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0KNbDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"6BOXswEACAAJ","etag":"36+rkP4RzSQ","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/6BOXswEACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Six Figure Crowdfunding","subtitle":"The No Bullsh*t Guide to Running a Life-Changing Campaign","authors":["Derek Miller","Noelle Pugh"],"publisher":"BOOM!

it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.<br> <br>Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible.”<br> <br>For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. In this revelatory book, Taleb will change the way you look at the world, and this second edition features a new philosophical and empirical essay, “On Robustness and Fragility,” which offers tools to navigate and exploit a Black Swan world.<br><br>Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications, <i>The Black Swan</i> is a landmark book—itself a black swan.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"081297381X"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780812973815"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":480,"printedPageCount":482,"dimensions":{"height":"21.00 cm","width":"13.00 cm","thickness":"2.30 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / Corporate Finance / General","Business & Economics / Decision-Making & Problem Solving","Social Science / Statistics"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":82,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.1.0.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=h2WMDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71sIZspOuFjN0oPNuuC7ZL1fbroGYGg_pmHlYpr_4n5TNU1bXX3xYObrnJFqpaFOZ6IXZe078YRNZvtG6L2Xm4Vf-K4a6YRggNp9yhbbWSZq6FWoRdJvtL2SwdsqtXhcfCRcWnf&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=h2WMDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70HkrIq0sI-lDerY2jMYgjd3jM3jn3SgjTaI1jZsMoX0NOrpB85Kf-HkjXtv13hDkHmMT23x1CdoTe67TcFc_rzRetRQT5dVf1zgmyGHfQkb9jL8q5vOUSdv1fH6JE8lQv3B8JJ&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=h2WMDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73Qb4yuh_mNyvFf798WFFERQ85L9LB6cYMBMejCtCnFx3J7Ot8vEE4QpbUGtL__0GPIO5GeZXPNsMTo6h-pTpPgvy4AapqjOFtaTvEK_5zJFgGPoGF53qCNSK8IePhijOJ9nJtO&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=h2WMDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70D4d5PVoNQjXqrIjuNGgiK1W9RydwSsCFzpNYoOab3hEj2LjhmIa0wpeIwPlYmmJ2U1iviRB7aq3DykFylbxLBYqub9cKZzBvYKni9h6AemEbWX3SaaPlhuQoeivjd8mawtnBu&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=h2WMDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73ZqBPB3Xb_eSFxQTb5mXlzHlHGUPqwvhq9rOblt_qK41_84QcrkH5et6hJx2f4_ZjgI6PPR4JyMN9YL8swKqi7oEJ4xmUiNbTnpDLFtrTbR4-dLuyFaeXC8L3wWGDmrCnvSvi2&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=h2WMDQAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h2WMDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h2WMDQAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=h2WMDQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"iyw6ul1x_n8C","etag":"zW2j49tzHCg","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/iyw6ul1x_n8C","volumeInfo":{"title":"Start with Why","subtitle":"How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action","authors":["Simon Sinek"],"publisher":"Penguin","publishedDate":"2009-10-29","description":"<p> </p><b>The inspiring, life-changing bestseller by the author of LEADERS EAT LAST and TOGETHER IS BETTER.</b><br><br>In 2009, Simon Sinek started a movement to help people become more inspired at work, and in turn inspire their colleagues and customers. Since then, millions have been touched by the power of his ideas, including more than 28 million who’ve watched his TED Talk based on START WITH WHY -- the third most popular TED video of all time.<br>  <br> Sinek starts with a fundamental question: Why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over? <br>  <br> People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with WHY. They realized that people won't truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the WHY behind it.  <br>  <br> START WITH WHY shows that the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world all think, act, and communicate the same way -- and it's the opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be led, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1101149035"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781101149034"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":256,"printedPageCount":258,"dimensions":{"height":"22.00 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / Leadership","Business & Economics / Entrepreneurship","Business & Economics / Motivational"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":33,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.20.13.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iyw6ul1x_n8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71SnKwCm57dZGOcv4E-qVJ-FlFWv9qKWImKncLw1p8v_eKHEiIZWBvjkpQiVpT0p1e8r4nSe5D6n1iPtg5l8bjFSD-1eV1a41gfDBun7nPkyeM50b6X9dRzvwb5GeXFWHMwLnBB&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iyw6ul1x_n8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72Inu1FSblpJODnS_jS79LDvGKv0luqwhHAsnEVPUhb3qaV_HT_nzC1i8T9P2YCMrAblMSbLF-SWSYHcl597aEe67ECQj4TL3UxJhtt2cg55tcl46uQ4w14pyq-SzkKSITtLBTO&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iyw6ul1x_n8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70cHEKTR-kW4EsgPNKCVBoIOPpKGp0Ti-7rDeDc2KSIUnFTEysjqdkfAlHjm1InuIKAckOtTh3cJyopn7DYQJtg7ddWz3D3cXgB8HY1uB6Mq8sAG9J_SDmpCsaNrMTIZh1R95Ud&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iyw6ul1x_n8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE719EDVEsixDsVjG43VMXMqbeAIOCYlfXzZBL3FfnTDHZjXWS62u6Ix179EM8j86UL6xYhNs7cX_gzJeSHg-XNDybzykyAQKWozLtXkvEw-yz9KicZ5m-TVYU5XrzHv3zqSWFHMY&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iyw6ul1x_n8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72KStoYz78X-FnzE8MF4oRegbAOCJCHQgd7t9kTcmHGKfdE6bjQhA3IBTB866BajLKEUy0Ee0TAKT5Pjuy1KdgafBVurkFPSWbBzt0i3Xx7hwtpgs_i4L8kYEk8DqPbWxl-1t68&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=iyw6ul1x_n8C&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iyw6ul1x_n8C&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iyw6ul1x_n8C"},"layerInfo":{"layers":[{"layerId":"geo","volumeAnnotationsVersion":"26"}]},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":10.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":10.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iyw6ul1x_n8C&rdid=book-iyw6ul1x_n8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":10990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":10990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.ca/books/download/Start_with_Why-sample-epub.acsm?id=iyw6ul1x_n8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iyw6ul1x_n8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"IeYmEAAAQBAJ","etag":"LhGszRI+BN8","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/IeYmEAAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Can't Hurt Me","subtitle":"Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds - Clean Edition","authors":["David Goggins"],"publisher":"David Goggins","publishedDate":"2021-04-01","description":"<p>New York Times Bestseller</p><p><br></p><p>Over 2.5 million copies sold</p><p><br></p><p>For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare - poverty, prejudice, and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy, and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. For Google to change the world (or even to survive), Page and Brin had to learn how to make tough choices on priorities while keeping their team on track. They'd have to know when to pull the plug on losing propositions, to fail fast. And they needed timely, relevant data to track their progress—to measure what mattered.<br><br>Doerr taught them about a proven approach to operating excellence: Objectives and Key Results. He had first discovered OKRs in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where the legendary Andy Grove (\"the greatest manager of his or any era\") drove the best-run company Doerr had ever seen. Later, as a venture capitalist, Doerr shared Grove's brainchild with more than fifty companies. Wherever the process was faithfully practiced, it worked.<br><br>In this goal-setting system, objectives define what we seek to achieve; key results are how those top-priority goals will be attained with specific, measurable actions within a set time frame. Everyone's goals, from entry level to CEO, are transparent to the entire organization. <br><br>The benefits are profound. OKRs surface an organization's most important work.

Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to <i>Fortune</i> magazine. Dalio himself has been named to <i>Time </i>magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success.<br> <br> In <i>Principles, </i>Dalio shares what he’s learned over the course of his remarkable career. He argues that life, management, economics, and investing can all be systemized into rules and understood like machines. The book’s hundreds of practical lessons, which are built around his cornerstones of “radical truth” and “radical transparency,” include Dalio laying out the most effective ways for individuals and organizations to make decisions, approach challenges, and build strong teams. He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy to life, such as creating “baseball cards” for all employees that distill their strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to make believability-weighted decisions. While the book brims with novel ideas for organizations and institutions, <i>Principles</i> also offers a clear, straightforward approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what they’re seeking to achieve.<br> <br> Here, from a man who has been called both “the Steve Jobs of investing” and “the philosopher king of the financial universe” (<i>CIO </i>magazine), is a rare opportunity to gain proven advice unlike anything you’ll find in the conventional business press.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1982112387"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781982112387"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":592,"printedPageCount":554,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / Personal Finance / Investing","Business & Economics / Personal Finance / General","Business & Economics / Leadership"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":4,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.5.4.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=qNNmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72umaobCasn636noj0BgtfW3mM-JRozNWo3Qs9YrVd2wytruFIV4WRtVKoZ5XSv-HEYiNWbLmG_dw9oqHPaJ8DJ6Blbwdqac4AAkVwPuvRqpt4QFV6TuBHlhKTbzJeTHwciukJ2&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=qNNmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71G_SPBQk49OqB9QJ2EPeXa5jbNjJTQJHb-7zcmmSgS2IO0XmOCGt-tfnnJoeaUqa5HYJK5L0WT2nX7QVxIFHS_hk7igPDQ7Ug2filp-nN6VNoTbjIUzUT-pbjtLU2Qp_1bhE0S&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=qNNmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE709ytIJgpxWDc0MQUNmI26HYVBvMshfEdU-ZC3fXRre95Nw61z6YrygygNAtv4NIPAMCUiAloXbotMH7PEu8DoP31Rpg1GzsbMfb2E0-Ciqjjrr1eqrLu42jL3mvf07VZZlyNoR&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=qNNmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE732JYk6l2Y-z04EuqrMRb4xqI5SW9o2RCZFF-aS7LEdv5vdMWnnHvIimdfM51yy_VABzZG0bKE6YuLU7V86dvPzsLz-sJL2koWYUOGrgaAhZg2PkVdbj-W-iPyOVhiw3pzFXnHd&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=qNNmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70iMLD2EjoWlHDo8mtIlo7aeoutYD3GOOuzBi_3js7j-8IP5Y-fVNkv3qcRJ-TvyOQ6BB2NQ9pY8I5IQVJiaZhwKPqQg6mvpJhMnj7tnRMDQZVRGShc6yFBmDTGzqJAnkJEq6N3&source=gbs_api","extraLarge":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=qNNmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71H66trZsC9SdYMA6lgMQZZdnKy2cGNiZ2JS1brxG5QwPq1KMZ-Fq80tNOugfsZjwKyPmJXSAmlp8N9XtW2vHW70OxuZTXCilVq7Ww4W8jsEmolDUZeFI4DCzXilEiPpKYAZqDX&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=qNNmDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qNNmDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qNNmDwAAQBAJ"},"layerInfo":{"layers":[{"layerId":"geo","volumeAnnotationsVersion":"6"}]},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.ca/books/download/Principles-sample-epub.acsm?id=qNNmDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=qNNmDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"lFhbDwAAQBAJ","etag":"Tv+uiDtTH00","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/lFhbDwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Atomic Habits","subtitle":"An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones","authors":["James Clear"],"publisher":"Penguin","publishedDate":"2018-10-16","description":"<b><b>The #1</b><b><i> New York Times</i></b><b> bestseller</b>. <b>Over 3 million copies sold!</b><br><br><b><i>Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results</i></b></b><br><br>No matter your goals, <i>Atomic Habits</i> offers a proven framework for improving--every day.

Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. <i>Nudge </i>is about how we make these choices and how we can make better ones. Using dozens of eye-opening examples and drawing on decades of behavioral science research, Nobel Prize winner Richard H. Thaler and Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein show that no choice is ever presented to us in a neutral way, and that we are all susceptible to biases that can lead us to make bad decisions. But by knowing how people think, we can use sensible “choice architecture” to nudge people toward the best decisions for ourselves, our families, and our society, without restricting our freedom of choice.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1101655097"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781101655092"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":320,"printedPageCount":322,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business

Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman's seminal studies in behavioral psychology, behavioral economics, and happiness studies have influenced numerous other authors, including Steven Pinker and Malcolm Gladwell. In <b>Thinking, Fast and Slow</b>, Kahneman at last offers his own, first book for the general public. It is a lucid and enlightening summary of his life's work. It will change the way you think about thinking.<br><br>Two systems drive the way we think and make choices, Kahneman explains: System One is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System Two is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Examining how both systems function within the mind, Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities as well as the biases of fast thinking and the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and our choices. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, he shows where we can trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking, contrasting the two-system view of the mind with the standard model of the rational economic agent.<br><br>Kahneman's singularly influential work has transformed cognitive psychology and launched the new fields of behavioral economics and happiness studies. In this path-breaking book, Kahneman shows how the mind works, and offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and personal lives--and how we can guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0385676522"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780385676526"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":512,"printedPageCount":614,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Psychology / Applied Psychology","Business & Economics / Organizational Behavior","Psychology / Social Psychology"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":3939,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.7.4.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TA7Q27RWlj0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71RF4QFcjKCI8kqx-AsNH6ShDnTFZOO4FB3jBpexFB_diVx2CCkGNk-qMnCFAm1M37RWmEy8Eo3Dh5kyJgL1EJVHJCH18y6lPmzOFJIFZtCkQHoTxDbMxsvYTm2ACT30G6KVp_1&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TA7Q27RWlj0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73ZUyzkeVYCiik0IEfVUoxt2g2rEgw8toA0kaKZ-e-a2eJdbD3etlcmxzWgg-6LtLiGUNl0BxWlFLwYvFvQFbaPDiJtUb3rMWPSvsMQWdxEVhFedB8cVIAKd7kHuAJEhBZ9T75u&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TA7Q27RWlj0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73WkZgiRv1PufbgyZtL2RxA-FDXd--OpksJYeVleikhC23LPY5oPbNPb33QxoEo4Kjtm3dZxhRAhyv5ZE2oWEFn6jJNuVJEQx77akWh_qN8CHw3kZScJdsVxIbp2rDu136aXop5&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TA7Q27RWlj0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73X11OgZ62miV0DFrCVRvH_yeCrWmGvN-GQNXU2tgVPI3cKROFWXhpA5mfuSWITo3stzD05aLuy8eaAuJNPL81me7QekjgIEmRiBPqgHts4R-WkTHvButtD07r6UWv60keSZ076&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TA7Q27RWlj0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70m9PzFrQSvngasYtYH6AUfIOm930tTPwzxT6XG-jTVIUBNeee351u6AoLwcetKLzs3TSfcS8Vg495hX-yDeSbqmI03cLlDx4ZWDPL6MxKYPp1YueCkVBU17xV0akDejUs3WrnA&source=gbs_api","extraLarge":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TA7Q27RWlj0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72YAOpJmx39v8bIpPzO8nsBH_sxSL13jE-TuUCjJecuI2IcZkKsECXRRgRXUTDiq2u2l60iJMqSREF5YqZROPTp11wQ2jiLhWAmxRKA8uT6SH8NQpNnWXljEDA9ctPsDFCKRmZr&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=TA7Q27RWlj0C&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TA7Q27RWlj0C&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TA7Q27RWlj0C"},"layerInfo":{"layers":[{"layerId":"geo","volumeAnnotationsVersion":"8"}]},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TA7Q27RWlj0C&rdid=book-TA7Q27RWlj0C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.ca/books/download/Thinking_Fast_and_Slow-sample-epub.acsm?id=TA7Q27RWlj0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=TA7Q27RWlj0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}}]}
