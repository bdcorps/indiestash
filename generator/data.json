You just need to be willing to break the rules.</b><br><br>At nineteen, I founded a software company with $119 in my bank account. Five years later, it was valued at $10.5 million. I don't consider myself exceptionally brilliant. I just realized something few people know: You don't need lots of money or an original idea to get really rich. <br><br>Now, I make more than $100,000 in passive income every month, while also running my own private equity firm and hosting <i>The Top Entrepreneurs</i> podcast, which has more than 10 million downloads. This book will show you how I went from college dropout to member of the New Rich. And I'm holding nothing back. You'll see my tax returns, my profit and loss statements, my email negotiations when buying and selling companies. <br><br>It's time to forget your grandfather's advice. I'll teach you how to be a modern opportunist--investor, entrepreneur, or side hustler--by breaking these four golden rules of the old guard:<br><br>1.Focus on one skill: Wrong. Don't cultivate one great skill to get ahead. In today's business world, success goes to the multitaskers.<br>2.Be unique: Wrong. The way to get rich is not by launching a new idea but by aggressively copying others and then adding your own twist. <br>3.Focus on one goal: Wrong. Focus instead on creating a system to produce the outcome you want, not just once, but over and over again. <br>4.Appeal to the masses: Wrong. The masses are broke ($4k average net worth in America?). Let others cut a trail through the jungle so you can peacefully walk in and capitalize on their hard work.<br><br>By rejecting these defunct rules and following my unconventional path, you can copy other people's ideas shamelessly, bootstrap a start-up with almost no funding, invest in small local businesses for huge payoffs, and reap all the benefits.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0525534458"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780525534457"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":288,"printedPageCount":290,"dimensions":{"height":"24.00 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / Personal Success","Business & Economics / Entrepreneurship","Business & Economics / Motivational"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.5.5.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70P03nZyxXBYYCBqVLcm8PPJNz8ZcTDxcaXUfHzThgHyqJ2QMymRfDIOpq8NyGw3GxjF1sTDidfu8fryl9ajb_bJI7MXgkoa2freJ3MHMbN013NoFgDsMdscOUgrbyxvruKg5Um&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71wDnq4COm7sYC0VxuRhbIV5IOcE4Pxfd0KLIT2IDKUVg8_-kfyUnm_EcrLi59hefU6qfVwM3Fkcto3_X50doRmK1Y8TERTzRsVZzCCFS-8ChiiuLMlzr3ME_H5vJcMRxeF7Kkm&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71kRtS19vzZdfnmMNHN4_OHs1YMCr1C4cDeQ1QV4kcFxdtEZzrtaFj9-sw07kFE6gFprTiNQ4D8b7psygXn7rF5O1Ei4xpcqmYZ8e7qbMFj6whGBfbiVBDWqa3v3cQ_l2kWHGkg&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70PYH2Bf7HFtcyT0KJd6UsCF5Y5NZ_1EainWRZ4sVL8Bvm7-XsEsDzRRH-YF_COwsB5xx7hn9P6pB-Ut_juoMgBNe1byglDOUI1wIDtjq0014t2kJBSbQXZnhUDvGX3kXTu5WiR&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72-pGR6Nmz4g5CUsRE8nyCehyVDIjgG6urKNkC1Fj9FTo-J7GfGKg0gV8mqN_U40NOtUHIz4rYvxVI5FV1JRTNhBqYQnBa_eG7nptM7aMGTM-ecaqyGgrEbvz5L6c3yUoEscq3U&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ"},"layerInfo":{"layers":[{"layerId":"geo","volumeAnnotationsVersion":"8"}]},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-3i9eDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"CAD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.ca/books/download/How_to_Be_a_Capitalist_Without_Any_Capit-sample-epub.acsm?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3i9eDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"2YeBy-RlgkQC","etag":"a9ZQRTz9fas","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/2YeBy-RlgkQC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The $100 Startup","subtitle":"Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do what You Love, and Create a New Future","authors":["Chris Guillebeau"],"publisher":"Crown Business","publishedDate":"2012","description":"In <i><b>The $100 Startup</b>, </i>Chris Guillebeau shows you how to lead of life of adventure, meaning and purpose – <i>and </i>earn a good living.<br> <br> Still in his early thirties, Chris is on the verge of completing a tour of every country on earth – he's already visited more than 175 nations – and yet he's never held a “real job” or earned a regular paycheck. Rather, he has a special genius for turning ideas into income, and he uses what he earns both to support his life of adventure and to give back. <br> <br> There are <i>many</i> <i>others </i>like Chris – those who've found ways to opt out of traditional employment and create the time and income to pursue what they find meaningful. Sometimes, achieving that perfect blend of passion and income doesn't depend on shelving what you currently do. You can start small with your venture, committing little time or money, and wait to take the real plunge when you're sure it's successful. <br> <br> In preparing to write this book, Chris identified 1,500 individuals who have built businesses earning $50,000 or more from a modest investment (in many cases, $100 or less), and from that group he's chosen to focus on the 50 most intriguing case studies. In nearly all cases, people with no special skills discovered aspects of their personal passions that could be monetized, and were able to restructure their lives in ways that gave them greater freedom and fulfillment.<br> <br> Here, finally, distilled into one easy-to-use guide, are the most valuable lessons from those who've learned how to turn what they do into a gateway to self-fulfillment. It's all about finding the intersection between your “expertise” – even if you don't consider it such -- and what other people will pay for. You don't need an MBA, a business plan or even employees. All you need is a product or service that springs from what you love to do anyway, people willing to pay, and a way to get paid.<br> <br> Not content to talk in generalities, Chris tells you exactly how many dollars his group of unexpected entrepreneurs required to get their projects up and running; what these individuals did in the first weeks and months to generate significant cash; some of the key mistakes they made along the way, and the crucial insights that made the business stick. Among Chris's key principles: if you're good at one thing, you're probably good at something else; never teach a man to fish – <i>sell</i> him the fish instead; and in the battle between planning and action, action wins. <br> <br> In ancient times, people who were dissatisfied with their lives dreamed of finding magic lamps, buried treasure, or streets paved with gold. Today, we know that it's up to us to change our lives. And the best part is, if we change our <i>own</i> life, we can help others change <i>theirs.</i> This remarkable book will start you on your way.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0307951529"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780307951526"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":285,"printedPageCount":306,"dimensions":{"height":"22.00 cm","width":"14.70 cm","thickness":"2.70 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics / Careers / General","Business & Economics / Entrepreneurship","Business & Economics / Small Business"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.5.1.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72za5IbUnlx9yXkxjMwHjuUyS0IaG_2KcvhZGaXK-I-qAl8Ba6iNMg3-Dk6VeAihe5dU8R0Eswdy8OsskRNvPuiz_OmRYrMnH0LbTA36cP51IFlQFwAzbZeFGBy6_Y7ZkVZQyiA&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70D3dzJ39Lo4VzwFbftqSXm3gPNr6NzYZtsMRUdkqd242KAmMyWtIXoP0mnijXJ4fMFgmV5NE167crTE4escMZq5WjywUgXw9_L_WyDf_qKE6WuVUFG5uH2ln90LGhJB--UVrG_&source=gbs_api","small":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72U_QsoOZYo2_f1Qt56y2xrHytEUgmAi_51Z6s-9xxbKIzIN0NTT-SfnUUTFmP9kN3w_n0u1vv7S0xUdjOW3KwoLv_lheGcdAoZuglpBG7KhJ7-hoesfdtonOEVbeo8xr40IVZ9&source=gbs_api","medium":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73Kt9NkClp0G8V4am0c0DpYULCBPMI81WHW0A_1Cl8w0iB51LcgcR2T7FL6RV-6pUBciBeZp7foH3l2QfuTRhSjJPPkER3jP-c4MT0YeW3-mzIAIrWcQwIXKTg0d1KEr-S0CJgy&source=gbs_api","large":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73vzZBjQh8hB2l1V5EwzT7WW7M5hv9odtVZ10aaiWwrov5p5RSfvil0lcYib5eVNgeQWM1qF2voXBtRbYNTfo-xg9EgKSVBNJENbLPkogncNzx6Z2BbB19DSJoUw8k7kVCb3Zhd&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2YeBy-RlgkQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"yagsDwAAQBAJ","etag":"xHEy+g0aONE","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/yagsDwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Consulting Bible","subtitle":"Everything You Need to Know to Create and Expand a Seven-Figure Consulting Practice","authors":["Alan Weiss"],"publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","publishedDate":"2011-04-05","description":"Everything you need to know about building a successful, world-class consulting practice <p>Whether you are a veteran consultant or new to the industry, an entrepreneur or the principal of a small firm, <i>The Consulting Bible</i> tells you absolutely everything you need to know to create and expand a seven-figure independent or boutique consulting practice.

It is that many of the problems we face - from crime to teenage delinquency to traffic jams - behave like epidemics. They aren't linear phenomena in the sense that they steadily and predictably change according to the level of effort brought to bear against them. They are capable of sudden and dramatic changes in direction. Years of well-intentioned intervention may have no impact at all, yet the right intervention - at just the right time - can start a cascade of change. Many of the social ills that face us today, in other words, are as inherently volatile as the epidemics that periodically sweep through the human population: little things can cause them to 'tip' at any time and if we want to understand how to confront and solve them we have to understand what those 'Tipping Points' are. In this revolutionary new study, Malcolm Gladwell explores the ramifications of this. Not simply for politicians and policy-makers, his method provides a new way of viewing everyday experience and enables us to develop strategies for everything from raising a child to running a company.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0349113467"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780349113463"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":279,"printedPageCount":279,"dimensions":{"height":"20.00 cm","width":"12.60 cm","thickness":"1.80 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Social Science / Sociology / General"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":4215,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EMELnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&imgtk=AFLRE72wrM-m46ME8DNsIwoJcyr7yQ_FevYT6_gmyBpETbEh__bKr_F-y7XdExwq3jF8A6IGdSuUmOvcb_R4pD-B0qoZjV_V1OpgrwXromwOj4K5SJyRAf1blDVTG0dnmN8XPKvVdfFl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EMELnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE7245jvm1BIgSwS5uJF06MP41pVWbBLAEMeffwrsg8qr1v5blHJwfMLuRFhoq6zBo1UPa-4BXPxuok-ODRZHHoHvigSpT0J7BfD05ZXFnJb8p2scmsr9i6C2MEQLfWtLTheGM3a0&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=EMELnwEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EMELnwEACAAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EMELnwEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"CA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"CA","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EMELnwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"jiUb_YkF-iEC","etag":"FiqAO2SzMjM","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/jiUb_YkF-iEC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Innovator's DNA","subtitle":"Mastering the Five Skills of Disruptive Innovators","authors":["Jeff Dyer","Jeffrey M.
